# Getting Started with Vite - React starter template

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project), and was created
to be very similar to Create-React-App, but faster and with batteries included!

## Using this template

There are 3 ways that you can adopt this template.

- Click the `Use this template` button on this repo, or click on [this link](https://github.com/samhwang/vite-starter-template/generate).
- Clone this repo, delete the .git folder and re-init the Git tree.
- Use `degit`: `npx degit samhwang/vite-starter-template project-name`

## Batteries included

### Runtime:

- [React](https://reactjs.org) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - The library for web and native user interfaces.
- [Tanstack Router](https://tanstack.com/router/) - To handle app client side routing
- [Tanstack Form](https://tanstack.com/form/) - To handle form creation and validation.

### Dev tools:

- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) - Fast, disk space efficient package manager.
- [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for code linting and formatting.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - The blazing fast frontend build tool.
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for running unit tests with [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/),
using [msw](https://mswjs.io/) to fake a service worker request to intercept API calls during testing..

## Available Scripts

```shell
pnpm run dev
pnpm run test
pnpm run format
pnpm run build
```

## Deployment

This template is assumed to be hosting provider agnostic. Please read the [Vite documentation on how to deploy your app](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy).
